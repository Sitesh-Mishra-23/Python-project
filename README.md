# Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains my Python projects. For now, it includes just one project, but more will be added as I build and explore new ideas.

## 📌 Current Project

# Fake News Headline Generator 📰

This is a fun Python project which generates random fake news-style headlines using the `random` library and predefined lists of subjects, actions, and locations. You can choose how many headlines to generate, and even save them to a file.

No external libraries needed – just run and enjoy the absurdity!
